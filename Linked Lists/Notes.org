* The "Runner Technique"

The "runner" (or second pointer) technique is used in many linked list
problems. The runner technique means that you iterate through the
linked list with two pointers simultaneously, with one ahead of the
other. The "fast" node might be ahead by a fixed amount, or it might
be hopping multiple nodes for each one node that "slow node" iterates
through.

* Recursion

A number of linked list problems rely on recursion. If you're having
trouble solving a linked list problem, you should explore if a
recursive approach will work.
